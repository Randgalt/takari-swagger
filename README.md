Utilities for working with Swagger

## Background

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a system for documenting RESTful APIs. It consists of a libraries and a [web-based console](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/). The libraries can be cumbersome to use and bring in many unwanted dependencies. Takari-Swagger is a simpler library that allows publishing the data needed by the Swagger console without most of the overhead.
